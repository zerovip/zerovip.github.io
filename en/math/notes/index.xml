I don&amp;rsquo;t have a pad letting me write on it when give a live broadcast, so I prepared these slides. Using slides is faster than writing on a blackboard, so it took me only one hour to finish this talk. Some proofs are a bit long and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to prepare, so all the proofs were handwritten, very flexible. That works well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seminar is about homological algebra, using Joseph J. Rotman, &lt;em&gt;An Introduction to Homological Algebra&lt;/em&gt; as our main reading material. My part is section 4.1 &amp;amp; 4.2, talking about semisimple rings with projective and injective modules, and von Neumann regular rings with flat modules. Somewhat easy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
