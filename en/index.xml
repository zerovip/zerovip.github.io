I don&amp;rsquo;t have a pad letting me write on it when give a live broadcast, so I prepared these slides. Using slides is faster than writing on a blackboard, so it took me only one hour to finish this talk. Some proofs are a bit long and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to prepare, so all the proofs were handwritten, very flexible. That works well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This seminar is about homological algebra, using Joseph J. Rotman, &lt;em>An Introduction to Homological Algebra&lt;/em> as our main reading material. My part is section 4.1 &amp;amp; 4.2, talking about semisimple rings with projective and injective modules, and von Neumann regular rings with flat modules. Somewhat easy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Books read</title><link>/en/record/book/</link><pubDate>2010-01-01</pubDate><guid>/en/record/book/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here are the books I have read.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Films watched</title><link>/en/record/film/</link><pubDate>2010-01-01</pubDate><guid>/en/record/film/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here are the films I have watched.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>/en/about/me/</link><pubDate>2000-01-01</pubDate><guid>/en/about/me/</guid><description>&lt;p>You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to know me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About the site</title><link>/en/about/site/</link><pubDate>2000-01-01</pubDate><guid>/en/about/site/</guid><description>&lt;p>Tags
