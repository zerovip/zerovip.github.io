1
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,560
Is it an emergency situation
that you would need

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,270
an oncall animal control officer
to go there?

3
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,020
Do you by any chance know if your parents
were married at the time of your birth?

4
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,270
She wants to speak about food tax.

5
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,640
Is the control box or open or missing?

6
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,930
So we just got a call from Boston Fire reporting a one alarm fire at 33

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,390
Browning Ave. in Dorchester,

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,640
and there’s no displacements
at this time.

9
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,140
Just wait one moment while I do
some research for you.

10
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,220
I’m going to open up a case for
the Parks Department. They deal with trees.

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,140
I got a call from Boston Police. The intersection of the VFW Parkway and LaGrange Street in West Roxbury.

12
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,810
The traffic signal is out.
I just want to confirm that you had it.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,890
I have a constituent that’s asking about
road maintenance.  Is it OK if I put him through?

14
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,350
Is it a stray dog?

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,640
She said she couldn’t see a visible cause.
Like there was no down wires or anything.

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,640
But the whole block appears to be out.

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,720
Is it blocking both the roadway
and the sidewalk?

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,270
Constituent’s saying her landlord turned off
her electricity to her apartment.

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,180
She said that she’s going back and forth
with him. They’re in court

20
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,930
with something and she thinks
she turned it off on him.
